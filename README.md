In the examples for this workshop, we will use the OpenAI and Together APIs.
For both of these, you need an API key. You can get an OpenAI API key
[here](https://platform.openai.com/). You can get a Together API key
[here](https://api.together.xyz/).

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of this project and add the
following:

```bash
# .env
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your key here>
TOGETHER_API_KEY=<your key here>
```

Install the required Python dependencies (inside a virtual environment):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
